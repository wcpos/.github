## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to the development repository for WooCommerce POS, a simple frontend for taking WooCommerce orders at the point of sale. 

WooCommerce POS consists of a [PHP plugin](https://github.com/wcpos/woocommerce-pos) and the POS application. The POS application is available for web, desktop, iOS and Android.

### Nightly versions of the POS can be found here:

- [WooCommerce POS PHP plugin](https://github.com/wcpos/woocommerce-pos/releases)
- [Desktop App](https://github.com/wcpos/electron/releases)
- [iOS & Android Apps](https://github.com/wcpos/managed-expo/labels/preview)

### Disclaimer

***DO NOT, under any circumstances, install the nightly version on a live site.***

The nightly versions will contain bugs which could be catastrophic for a live WooCommerce store. You will receive not support if you install the nightly version on a live site.

### Support

If you are helping test the nightly builds you will probably want to jump in the Discord chat for live assistance.
